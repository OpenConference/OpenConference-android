# OpenConference

This repositoy offers an android app that can be used by any conference to display information like sessions, speaker etc. about the conference in a native android app

Originally this app has been build for droidcon Berlin, but the app can be styled and configured freely so that it can be used by other conferences as well.


# For your conference

The documentation is not available yet, but basically there are two ways to create your own android app for your conference (based on this source code):

1. Create a product flavor for your conference: Android's gradle plugin allows us to have multiple product flavors. If you use product flavors, you can benefit from some features like CI and testing. If you need help, please create an issue here on github.

2. Fork the whole repository and do your own thing.


# Connect to your backend
This app is has been built with changeable, modular and components in mind. We use dagger 2 for dependency injection and so you can override almost all components to match your needs. The most important one is: [BackendScheduleAdapter](https://github.com/OpenConference/OpenConference-android/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/openconference/model/backend/schedule/BackendScheduleAdapter.kt) where you define how to load data from your backend (i.e. by using Retrofit).

Custom styling can be applied by overriding default xml styles and layouts files.
